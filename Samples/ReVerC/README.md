# ReVerC Sample

This sample shows how to structure a Q# program using
[ReVerC](https://github.com/msr-quarc/ReVerC) 
to generate reversible circuits from F# code quotations.

## Prerequisites
To run ReVerC within a Q# project the following prerequisites are required:
+ rever.dll
+ fstarlib.dll
+ F# interactive mode (fsi.exe)

rever.dll and fstarlib.dll are included in this sample for convenience, but
can otherwise be obtained by compiling ReVerC from 
[source](https://github.com/msr-quarc/ReVerC).

To obtain fsi.exe, simply
[install F#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/get-started/install-fsharp?tabs=windows).
By default fsi.exe is not added to the default windows PATH, so the standard
install location (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\F#\10.1\Framework\v4.0\fsi.exe`) 
for fsi.exe has been hardcoded into the build events of this project. If fsi.exe is not
located here, the above path in the project's pre-build events 
(right click "ReVerC" -> properties -> build events)
must be changed to the correct path for visual studio to correctly locate fsi.exe.

## Running
On building the project,
1. A file "adder.qs" will be generated by running the F# script AdderGen.fsx
2. The driver will import and run code from both Operation.qs and adder.qs

If successful, the program should output
```
1 + 1 = 2
```
indicating that the compiled adder circuit has correctly performed the quantum
addition of 1 + 1.
